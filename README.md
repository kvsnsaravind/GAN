# MNIST GAN using TensorFlow/Keras

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using TensorFlow and Keras to generate handwritten digit images similar to those in the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).

## 🧠 Project Overview

A GAN is composed of two neural networks — a **Generator** and a **Discriminator** — competing in a zero-sum game:
- The **Generator** tries to produce realistic images from random noise.
- The **Discriminator** tries to distinguish between real MNIST images and fake ones generated by the Generator.

Through adversarial training, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic images.

## 🗂 Minimum requirements:

```
tensorflow>=2.0
numpy
matplotlib


```

**This script will:**

  1. Train the GAN on MNIST digits for 10 epochs (you can change this).

  2. Show a grid of 16 generated digits after training.

### 🧱 Model Architecture

🔁 Generator

```
- Dense → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU → Reshape
- Conv2DTranspose → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU
- Conv2DTranspose → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU
- Conv2DTranspose (Output with tanh activation)


```

Takes 100-dimensional random noise as input and generates a 28x28 grayscale image.

🔎 Discriminator

```

- Conv2D → LeakyReLU → Dropout
- Conv2D → LeakyReLU → Dropout
- Flatten → Dense (sigmoid output)

```

Takes 28x28 grayscale image and outputs a single probability (real/fake).

### 🏋️‍♂️ Training Loop

For each batch in the training dataset:

 1.Generate fake images using the Generator.
 2.Get predictions on real and fake images from the Discriminator.
 3.Compute the Generator loss (how well it fools the Discriminator).
 4.Compute the Discriminator loss (how well it separates real and fake).
 5.Update both models using their respective gradients.

Sample Training Output:

```
Epoch 1, Gen Loss: 0.8321, Disc Loss: 1.3425
Epoch 2, Gen Loss: 1.0274, Disc Loss: 1.2013

```

### Visual Output:
After training, a 4x4 grid of generated digits is displayed using matplotlib.

### 🎯 Loss Functions
Binary Crossentropy is used for both Generator and Discriminator:

Discriminator:

Real images → label 1

Fake images → label 0

Generator:

Wants fake images to be labeled as real (label 1)
